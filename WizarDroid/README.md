Overview
--------

WizarDroid is a lightweight Android library that addresses a feature that Android is surprisingly missing, Wizards. It is built on top of Android's ViewPager to enable slide animation and touch functionality.

Key advantages:

* Built-in basic wizard layout with paging and slide animation
* Wizard context for persisting data in the wizard
* Support for nested fragments
* Wizard's flow is defined in one place and can be maintained easily
* Simple API for controlling wizard's flow in runtime
